          <h2>About the Legend</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (/mændɛlə/;[1] Xhosa: [xolíɬaɬa mandɛ̂la];
            born Rolihlahla Mandela; 18 July 1918 5 December 2013) was a South
            African anti-apartheid activist and politician who served as the
            first president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the
            country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully
            representative democratic election. His government focused on
            dismantling the legacy of apartheid by fostering racial
            reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist,
            he served as the president of the African National Congress (ANC)
            party from 1991 to 1997.
            <br />
            <br />
            A Xhosa, Mandela was born into the Thembu royal family in Mvezo,
            South Africa. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the
            University of Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in
            Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial and African
            nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its
            Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's white-only
            government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation
            that privileged whites, Mandela and the ANC committed themselves to
            its overthrow. He was appointed president of the ANC's Transvaal
            branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952
            Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. He was
            repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was unsuccessfully
            prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by Marxism, he
            secretly joined the banned South African Communist Party (SACP).
            Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association
            with the SACP he co-founded the militant uMkhonto we Sizwe in 1961
            and led a sabotage campaign against the government. He was arrested
            and imprisoned in 1962, and, following the Rivonia Trial, was
            sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the
            state.
            <br />
            <br />
            Mandela served 27 years in prison, split between Robben Island,
            Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic
            and international pressure and fears of racial civil war, President
            F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk led
            efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the 1994
            multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory
            and became president. Leading a broad coalition government which
            promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation
            between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and
            Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses.
            Economically, his administration retained its predecessor's liberal
            framework despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing
            measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty and expand
            healthcare services. Internationally, Mandela acted as mediator in
            the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as secretary-general
            of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second
            presidential term and was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki.
            Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty
            and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation.
